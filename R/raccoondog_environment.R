#' Raccoon dog activity and environmental factors in China
#'
#' This dataset contains records of raccoon dog (*Nyctereutes procyonoides*) detections and other mammal
#' species from camera traps in the Sizuolou Nature Reserve, Beijing, China, along with associated 
#' environmental variables. The data was collected from October 15, 2023, to February 29, 2024, 
#' covering both autumn and winter seasons. The study examined seasonal activity changes in raccoon dogs
#' and their relationship to environmental and mammalian factors.
