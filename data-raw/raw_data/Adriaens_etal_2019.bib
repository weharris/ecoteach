	abstract = {Non-native Berberis aquifolium is notoriously invasive in Belgian coastal
 dunes. With its strong clonal growth through suckers, this evergreen shrub
 outcompetes native species and affects dune succession. To prevent further
 secondary spread and mitigate its impact, there was an urgent need for
 knowledge on the effectiveness of control measures, both at the plant and
 habitat level. Here, we report on a first control experiment. Individual
 B. aquifolium clones were subjected to one of four treatments (manual
 uprooting, foliar herbicide application, stem cutting followed by
 herbicide or salt application), with regrowth being measured up to one
 year after treatment. Plants proved most susceptible to foliar herbicide
 application (5\% glyphosate solution), resulting in 77\% of the clones
 apparently killed. We discuss the limitations of our experiment and the
 potential for actual field application of the different treatments. We
 present some guidelines for future control that may become further refined
 as experience builds up.},
