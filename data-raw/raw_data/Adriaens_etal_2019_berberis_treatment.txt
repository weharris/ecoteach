Berberis aquifolium Management Treatment Dataset
Dataset Overview
This dataset contains experimental data from a management treatment study of Berberis aquifolium (Oregon grape) plants conducted across four heavily infested dune sites. The study evaluated the effectiveness of different management treatments on individual plants with limited clonal extension. Treatments were applied in April/May 2013, with regrowth assessments conducted after 6 months (November 2013) and 1 year (May 2014).

Total observations: 127 treated clones
Retrieved for analysis: 118 clones (9 could not be relocated)

Variable Descriptions
Identification and Location Variables
p
lant_id (String)
Unique identifier for each individual B. aquifolium plant/clone

region (String)
Field code identifying the dune site where the plant was located

x_proj (Float)
X-coordinate of plant location (GPS projection)

y_proj (Float)
Y-coordinate of plant location (GPS projection)
Treatment and Timing Variables

date (String)
Date when the plant was initially located and treated (April/May 2013)

treatment (String)
Management treatment applied to the plant:
• DIG - Manual uprooting by digging with shovels
• LEAF - Leaf spray treatment with 5% Roundup Max (450g/l glyphosate)
• STUB - Stem treatment (cut and paint) with 5% glyphosate solution
• SALT - Stem treatment with saturated salt (NaCl) solution

Plant Morphology Variables

height (Integer)
Plant height measured in centimeters

diameter (Integer)
Clone diameter measured in centimeters (average: 85 cm, range: 10 cm - 6 m)

n_stems (Integer)
Number of stems counted per individual plant/clone
Treatment Response Variables

date_regrowth (String)
Date of regrowth assessment (November 2013 or May 2014)

regrowth (String)
Category of stem regrowth response:
• dead - No regrowth observed
• limited regrowth - Some regrowth but restricted
• vigorous regrowth - Strong regrowth response
Experimental Design Notes

Plants were located using a hand-held Garmin Foretrex 401 GPS
Each plant was photographed and marked with a flag for relocation
Treatments were alternated in sequence to ensure spatial separation (minimum 10 meters apart)
All ramets within a clone received the same treatment
The 5% glyphosate concentration used exceeds the standard recommendation (1.5-2%) for leaf treatment
Salt treatment quantities were designed to remain below natural soil salt concentration levels
Treatment effectiveness was assessed at 6 months and 1 year post-treatment

Data Collection Period

Initial treatment: April/May 2013
First assessment: November 2013 (6 months post-treatment)
Final assessment: May 2014 (1 year post-treatment)

Missing Data
Nine treated clones could not be retrieved during follow-up assessments, likely due to flag removal by site visitors. The remaining 118 clones were approximately equally distributed across sites and treatments.
