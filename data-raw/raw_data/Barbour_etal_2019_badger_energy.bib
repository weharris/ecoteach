	abstract = {1. Energy availability and energy use directly influence an organismâ€™s
 life history, fitness and ecological function. In wild animals, abiotic
 factors such as ambient temperature, season and rainfall, and biotic
 factors such as body mass, age, social group size and disease status, all
 potentially influence energy balance. 2. Relatively few studies have
 examined the effects of disease on the energy expenditure of wild animals.
 Such studies could further our understanding of factors influencing the
 transmission of zoonotic diseases. The European badger (Meles meles) is a
 medium-sized carnivore that occurs in mixed-sex, familial groups across
 much of its range. In the UK they are a protected species but are also
 involved in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. 3. We
 measured the daily energy expenditure (DEE) and resting metabolic rate
 (RMR) of wild badgers and related this to their TB infection status and a
 range of other interacting factors including season, group size, disease
 status, sex, age, body mass and body fat. 4. Individuals were larger and
 fatter when they were older and fatter during the winter. Males were also
 heavier than females during the summer. In addition, individuals from
 smaller groups that were exposed to TB tended to have lower body mass. 5.
 There were no direct effects of disease status on DEE or RMR, however,
 there was a significant interaction whereby DEE increased with body mass
 in small groups but decreased with body mass in large groups. 6. Results
 are consistent with the costs of TB infection being met by compensatory
 mechanisms enabling badgers to survive for extended periods without
 exhibiting measurable energetic consequences.},
