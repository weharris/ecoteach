	abstract = {Small hibernators are long-lived for their size because seasonal dormancy
 greatly reduces predation risk. Thus, within a year, hibernators switch
 between states of contrasting mortality risk (active season versus
 hibernation), making them interesting species for testing the predictions
 of life-history theory. Accordingly, we hypothesized that, with advancing
 age and hence diminishing reproductive potential, hibernators should
 increasingly accept the higher predation risk associated with activity to
 increase the likelihood of current reproductive success. For edible
 dormice (Glis glis) we show that age strongly affects hibernation/activity
 patterns, and that this occurs via two pathways: (i) with increasing age,
 dormice are more likely to reproduce, which delays the onset of
 hibernation, and (ii) age directly advances emergence from hibernation in
 spring. We conclude that hibernation has to be viewed not merely as an
 energy saving strategy under harsh climatic conditions, but as an
 age-affected life-history trait that is flexibly used to maximize fitness.},
