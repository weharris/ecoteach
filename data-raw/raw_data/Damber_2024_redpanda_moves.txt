# Red pandas on the move: weather and disturbance effects on habitat specialists

[https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cjsxksngd](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cjsxksngd)

## Description of the data and file structure

This is based on GPS telemetry of 10 red pandas which were tracked for four months (1 December 2019  ̶  31 March 2020). The weather data, except temperature, was collected in the field, while temperature was recorded by in-built sensors in the GPS collars. Geo-physical and disturbance variables were retrieved using the ArcMap. The details of the methodology used for data collection are presented in the article.

### Files and variables

#### File: Data.xlsx

**Description:** Data is presented in two sheets: Data_*DistanceVsVariables and Data*_SnowCoverVsVariables.

##### Variables

Data_*DistanceVsVariables *sheet contains eight columns (variables) and 218 rows, with each row representing data collected for an individual red panda over a 24 hour.

* Animal_id: This includes the id of 10 study animals.
* Sex: Male, Female
* Age: Adult, Subadult
* Distance: Daily travel distance (m) covered by an individual in 24 hours
* Precipitation: Clear, Snowfall, Rainfall
* Snow_cover: Yes, No
* Snow_age: Fresh, Old, No_snow
* Temperature: Mean daily temperature (oC)

*Data*_SnowCoverVsVariablessheet includes 14 columns (variables) and 704 rows, where each row corresponds to data from a specific location at a particular time for an individual red panda. Given the endangered status of the study animals, the coordinates of their location are not included in this sheet.

* Animal_id: This includes the id of 10 study animals.
* Sex: Male, Female
* Precipitation: Clear, Snowfall, Rainfall
* Snow_cover: Yes, No
* Snow_age: Fresh, Old, No_snow
* Temperature: Mean daily temperature (oC)
* Solar: Solar radiation (KW/m2)
* NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
* Road: Distance to road (m)
* Settlement: Distance to settlement (m)
* Herding shed: Distance to herding shed (m)
* Elevation: Elevation (m)
* Aspect: Aspect (o)
* Slope: Slope (o)
