	abstract = {Anthropogenic noise constrains the transmission of birdsong and alters the
 behavior of receivers. Many birds adjust their acoustic signals to
 minimize the interference of anthropogenic noise on signal transmission.
 Birds may also change their acoustic signals to exchange information
 during aggressive interactions. However, it is unclear how birds deal with
 a potential trade-off between adjusting their acoustic signals to better
 transmit in noisy environments versus mediating aggressive interactions.
 Additionally, we do not know how urbanization and anthropogenic noise
 alters the territorial behavior of receivers. We investigated the
 interplay among song, territorial aggression, urbanization, and
 anthropogenic noise, in males of the southern house wren (Troglodytes
 aedon musculus), using recordings of spontaneous songs (non-aggressive
 context) and a playback experiment simulating a male territorial intrusion
 (aggressive context). We found that urban wrens behaved more aggressively
 in response to the intruder by singing more and spent more time closer to
 the intruder than rural wrens regardless of noise. Males produced songs
 with lower minimum frequency and trills with wider frequency bandwidth and
 higher vocal performance under acute (playback) than relaxed
 (post-playback) aggressive encounters. These results suggest that males
 use songs to communicate aggressive intent or fighting ability. Urban
 wrens produced higher-pitched songs and trills than rural wrens
 irrespective of aggressive context. Urban wrens in the noisiest
 territories also produced the highest-pitched trills but only in the
 non-aggressive context. Rural wrens in the noisiest territories tended to
 produce the longest songs (non-aggressive context) or produced the
 shortest songs (aggressive context). Results suggest that urbanization
 affects territorial and vocal behaviors in southern house wrens. Males in
 this species seem to primarily adjust acoustic signals in response to the
 territorial intruder rather than noise.},
