	abstract = {Sharks are among the most threatened groups of exploited fishes,
 comprising common bycatch across many fisheries. Management efforts
 intended to safeguard threatened species have increasingly focused on
 retention bans to reduce bycatch mortality. However, the population
 effects of such measures remain unevaluated across species. We combined
 available data from 160 studies providing estimates of at-vessel or
 post-release mortality for 147 taxa caught by different fishing gears to
 create random-forest regression models and predict mortality rates for 341
 shark species incidentally captured by longlines or gillnets.
 Smaller-bodied species inhabiting shallow waters were more likely to
 suffer at-vessel mortality compared to their deep-water counterparts,
 which were more likely to suffer post-release mortality. We then use
 results for longlines to simulate the effect of retention bans in reducing
 fishing mortality to sustainable levels. Our metric consists of the ratio
 between the proportion of each speciesâ€™ population caught and discarded
 (PMAX) under a retention ban divided by the fishing mortality (F)
 predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield (FMSY). Our calculations
 show that a retention ban yielded an average {\textasciitilde}three-fold higher PMAX
 compared to FMSY, with 18\% of the species having PMAX/FMSY \&lt; 2,
 72.3\% having 2 \&lt; PMAX/FMSY \&lt; 5, and 9.7\% having PMAX/FMSY
 \&gt; 5. For threatened species, median PMAX/FMSY = 2.28 and
 non-threatened ones had median PMAX/FMSY = 2.77. Our study shows that
 retention prohibitions could reduce shark mortality, but must be combined
 with additional measures to stop overfishing, especially for
 low-productivity species.},
