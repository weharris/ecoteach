	abstract = {Agricultural use metrics were calculated for 66 elephants as part of a
 study to characterize crop use tactics in the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem in
 Kenya and Tanzania. Metrics were calculated to capture mean agricultural
 use, maximum use from a moving average, and the difference
 between mean and max use. These metrics were used to classify agricultural
 use tactics for each elephant using Gaussian mixture models. Tables are
 provided with metrics and tactic classifications for the lifetime track
 (TableS3) and individual years (TableS4). Data contained in these
 files can be used to reproduce and further investigate Guassian mixture
 model clustering and cutpoint calculation, agricultural use
 linear mixed models, and tactic change generalized logistic mixed models
