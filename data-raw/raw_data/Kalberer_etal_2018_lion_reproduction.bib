	abstract = {Variation in life history traits is directly linked to individual fitness.
 This interplay is complicated by environmental perturbations in an
 unpredictable habitat. To maximise fitness, individuals react to
 environmental changes by reallocating resources between maintenance,
 growth and reproduction. Disentangling these factors is complicated as
 traits are interlinked by trade-offs between current reproduction and
 future survival and reproduction. This study provides first estimates of
 life history traits and trade-offs of a tropical apex predator, the
 Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki), in an unpredictable habitat, the
 Galapagos archipelago. Thirteen years of individual data on birth mass,
 early growth and offspring, and environmental data allowed the examination
 of factors influencing reproductive performance of adult females and
 calculation of pupping rates. Females became primiparous between ages 4
 and 9. Neither oceanographic nor body condition in the females’ first year
 of life influenced age at primiparity. Age at primiparity had no effect on
 a female’s birth rate, on average one pup every 2 years. Sex of a pup did
 not influence the subsequent inter-birth interval, but first-year pup
 survival lengthened it. Until age 6, females showed lower birth rate
 (\&lt; 0.40). Fecundity was higher between age 6 and 14 (birth rate
 0.40–0.48). We could not detect an influence of inter-annually differing
 oceanographic conditions on pupping rates. Female Galapagos sea lions
 appear to deal with variation in early-life history traits and
 environmental unpredictability by a low but stable reproductive output
 modified only by the trade-off between current and future reproduction.},
