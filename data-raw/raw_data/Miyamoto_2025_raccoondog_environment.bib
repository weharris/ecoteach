	abstract = {Raccoon dogs Nyctereutes procyonoides are on the List of National Key
 Protected Wild Animals as Grade II in China; research on their wild
 populations is limited despite their conservation significance. In this
 context, we focused on seasonal activity changes from autumn to winter and
 their relationship to environmental and mammalian factors. Using 71 trail
 cameras from October 15, 2023, to February 29, 2024, in the Sizuolou
 Nature Reserve in Beijing, China, this study is the first to examine these
 specific aspects within the country. Our findings revealed a statistically
 significant change in raccoon dog activity from autumn to winter. This
 suggests they may enter short periods of winter sleep, as indicated by the
 20-day intervals without camera detections. The average re-photographing
 interval was 2.62 Â± 3.41 (SD) days. In the daily activity pattern, kernel
 density estimation indicated that raccoon dogs were nocturnal in both
 seasons; however, daytime activity was observed only in autumn. Our
 results revealed that proximity to agricultural land negatively affected
 and the presence of Siberian roe deer positively influenced the number of
 raccoon dog events. Additionally, our results supported the previous
 categorisation of raccoon dogs into two habitat types, with our study
 population being near the type that avoids agricultural land. Our findings
 suggested that raccoon dogs and Siberian roe deer co-occur due to raccoon
 dogs preferring habitats that were also favoured by deer.},
