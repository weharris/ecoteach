	abstract = {While female mate choice is well established, mutual choice may play a
 larger role in mate selection than currently recognized. Assortative
 mating is a common form of non-random mating in animals that can result
 from mutual choice. However, few studies address assortative patterns
 beyond the social pair, potentially overlooking assortativity in the
 mating pair and in the social environment that shapes reproductive
 decisions. We asked whether North American barn swallows (Hirundo rustica
 erythrogaster) breeding in a large colony form pairs, mate (through both
 within-pair and extra-pair fertilizations), and interact assortatively by
 ventral plumage color, wing length, and age. Social interactions were
 tracked using proximity loggers, which recorded close contact between
 tagged individuals when birds were mating and laying eggs. Barn swallows
 paired and mated assortatively by their ventral plumage color; however,
 the assortative patterns in mating pairs were not as strong as they were
 in social pairs. Barn swallows also interacted assortatively, associating
 more often with individuals of both sexes who had similar phenotypes
 relative to the other birds in the colony. Finally, older males and
 females with darker ventral plumage achieved the highest reproductive
 success. Investigation of assortative behavior beyond the level of the
 social pair provides a more complete understanding of mate choice and
 suggests a mechanism that may maintain the large variation in ventral
 plumage color in North American barn swallows.},
