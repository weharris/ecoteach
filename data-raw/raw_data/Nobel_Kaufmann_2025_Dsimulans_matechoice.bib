	abstract = {To facilitate the search for a suitable mating partner, many animals
 across all taxa use social information. One form of social learning is
 mate copying, in which individuals use information about potential mates
 by copying the mate choices of other individuals. While many studies have
 documented mate copying in Drosophila melanogaster and its potential for
 cultural evolution in the laboratory, little is known about mate copying
 in other Drosophila species. Here we report the first evidence that
 Drosophila simulans females can also acquire a sexual preference for a
 particular trait of a male after observing a single mating event. We used
 the same protocol developed for D. melanogaster: A naïve, unmated female
 first observes a conspecific's mate choice between one artificially
 colored green and one artificially colored pink male, and is subsequently
 allowed to choose between two males of the same phenotype herself. Just as
 with D. melanogaster, D. simulans females were more likely to choose the
 same type of male as in the demonstration. Thus, D. simulans females are
 capable of rapid social observational learning, and this highlights the
 potential importance of mate copying, a trait that may contribute to
 reproductive isolation.},
