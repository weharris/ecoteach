	abstract = {Toothed whales (odontocetes) make use of high-frequency sounds to
 echolocate, differing significantly from their sister group baleen whales
 (mysticetes), which make use of low-frequency sound for long-distance
 communication. This divergence in auditory ability has led to considerable
 speculation as to how hearing functioned in the ancestral archaeocetes,
 and when the specialisations of modern species arose. Numerous studies
 have attempted to infer auditory capabilities from morphological
 correlates valid in modern species. Here, we build upon these previous
 methods with a focus on cochlear structures that have well-understood
 links to function. We combine this with information on the sound
 conduction apparatus to chart the evolutionary trajectory of cetacean
 hearing. Our results suggest an initial move towards low-frequency
 specialisation in early Eocene cetaceans, which coincides with the
 appearance of new sound conduction pathways. This paved the way for the
 later movement towards higher frequency hearing in protocetids, however
 the ultra-high and low-frequency hearing specialisations of both modern
 cetacean clades evolved after their divergence. We use this data to test
 the hypotheses that evolutionary brain size increases in cetaceans were
 related to the origin of high-frequency echolocation. We show that no
 shift in relative brain size coincides with any changes towards
 high-frequency perception. However, this does not rule out a role for
 other changes in hearing ability such as some simple forms of
 echolocation, similar to that suggested for hippopotamuses or bowhead
 whales, which may have been present in even the earliest cetaceans.},
