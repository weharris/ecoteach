MagPenguinDeployments.csv
This dataset contains one row per penguin per breeding season. Some penguins were tracked in more than one breeding season.

Columns:
SeasonYear	Calendar year of the beginning of the breeding season (September-February). 
PenguinID	ID number of the penguin.	
PenguinSeq	Unique identifier of the penguin. Some penguins have more than one type of ID, hence more than one ID number.
InstrumentSeq	Unique identifier of the deployment (penguin tracked in a breeding season).
NTripPairsLong	Number of long (duration >= 1 day) trip pairs the penguin made during the deployment of the tracking tag.
DistBetMean	Mean distance (km) between the endpoints of consecutive long trips by the penguin during the deployment.
DistBetSD	Standard deviation of the distance between the endpoints of consecutive long trips by the penguin during the deployment. NA = not applicable (number of trip pairs = 1).
DistBetMin	Minimum distance (km) between the endpoints of consecutive long trips by the penguin during the deployment.
DistBetMax	Maximum distance (km) between the endpoints of consecutive long trips by the penguin during the deployment.
InstrType	Type of tracking instrument: 1 = Argos PTT; 2 = GPS archival tag.
InstrModel	Model of the tracking instrument. See paper for details.
NFledged	Number of chicks that fledged: last seen after 10 January and weighed at least 1800 g.
DurDaysMean	Mean duration (days) of trips during the deployment.
TripDistMean	Mean straight-line distance (km) between the penguin's nest and the at-sea location farthest from the nest for each trip during the deployment (trip endpoints).
BearingMean	Mean bearing (degrees) from the penguin's nest to the at-sea location farthest from the nest for each long trip (duration >= 1 day) during the deployment. North = 360. Arithmetic mean was used because long-trip bearings ranged from 8 to 153 degrees. It was not necessary to treat bearing as a circular variable.
PenguinSex	Sex of the penguin: 1 = female; 0 = male.
NumTrips	Number of trips recorded during the deployment.
NumChicksDeploy	Number of chicks in the nest when the tracking tag was attached to the penguin (1 or 2).
NumChicksStarved	Number of chicks that died of starvation (0 or 1; no penguin in this study had both chicks die of starvation).
DeployDurDays	Duration of the tracking tag deployment (days).
ChlaMean	Mean chlorophyll-a (mg/m^3) for the breeding season. NA = missing data.
