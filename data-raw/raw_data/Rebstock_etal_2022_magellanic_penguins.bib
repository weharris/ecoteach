	abstract = {Seabirds must find food efficiently in the dynamic ocean environment to
 succeed at raising chicks. In theory, site familiarity, gained by prior
 experience in a place, should increase foraging efficiency when prey is
 predictable, and translate into increased reproductive success, though
 this is difficult to test empirically. To address this, we examined
 foraging-site fidelity in Magellanic penguins, Spheniscus magellanicus,
 using movement data from 180 individuals tracked during 23 breeding
 seasons when penguins make repeated trips from their colony to feed
 chicks. We tested whether chlorophyll-a concentration, as a proxy for
 ocean productivity, affects foraging-site fidelity. We then tested whether
 foraging-site fidelity affects foraging efficiency and reproductive
 success. Mean foraging-site fidelity was higher in years with higher ocean
 productivity, when fronts had stronger gradients in temperature and
 chlorophyll, and prey was likely more predictable. When returning to
 previously visited foraging sites, penguins arrived and returned faster
 than predicted for a trip of a given distance, leading to lower mean trip
 durations and more frequent trips in penguins with high site fidelity.
 Increased foraging efficiency and chick-feeding frequency in turn led to
 increased chick survival. Our study reveals that foraging efficiency is a
 key mechanism linking foraging-site fidelity and reproductive success.},
