	abstract = {Carrion is a valuable resource in forests, providing sustenance for
 vertebrate and invertebrate scavenger communities and contributing to
 ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling. Intensive ungulate hunting,
 and thereby extraction of carcasses, removes large quantities of potential
 carrion from the system, denying a valuable resource from scavenger fauna.
 It may be possible to reduce the loss and negative consequences to forest
 biodiversity by retaining evisceration residues from hunted deer, where
 full carcasses cannot be retained. However, what roll evisceration
 residues play as a resource for scavengers in temperate forests is not
 well understood. In this study, we exposed 47 carrion samples from hunted
 roe deer, in front of triple sets of camera traps, to examine how hunting
 remains are removed and fed upon by vertebrate scavengers. Overall, 70 \%
 of the samples were completely removed from experimental sites by
 vertebrates. We detected twelve vertebrate taxa feeding on evisceration
 residues, including martens (Martes spp.), red kites (Milvus milvus) and
 garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus). Common buzzards (Buteo buteo) and
 Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius) were the most frequent feeders on
 carrion samples, while red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) displaced the largest
 proportion of samples. Finally, we found a range of insectivorous bird and
 mammal species using hunting remains as a source for invertebrate prey,
 while not scavenging on the remains directly. We demonstrate that
 evisceration residues can be a valuable resource for a wide range of taxa
 and suggest that viscera retention from hunted game may contribute to
 resource provisioning for scavengers in forest ecosystems.},
