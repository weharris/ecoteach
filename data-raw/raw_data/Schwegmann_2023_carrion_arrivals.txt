Use of viscera from hunted roe deer by vertebrate scavengers in summer in central European mountainous mixed forest
Published in Wildlife Biology 
Dataset from 47 roe deer evisceration residues samples exposed to vertebrate scavenging in front of triple sets of camera traps in the university forest of freiburg.
Owner: Sebastian Schwegmann (sebastian.schwegmann@gmail.com)

General remarks: 
Between May and October 2022 eight roe deer viscera samples from hunted roe deer per month were exposed to vertebrate scavenging in front of camera traps on 47 individual locations. Samples visits, feeding and removal events of samples by vertebrate scavengers were assessed. Events were deemed independent if more than 20 minutes passed between consecutive pictures. Samples were observed for a maximum of 16 days. The data was used to assess the composition of the vertebrate scavenging fauna using evisceration residues, to determine which scavengers remove entire samples of residues and how long viscera are available to invertebrate scavenging.
