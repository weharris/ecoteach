	abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances are known to modify plant-animal interactions
 such as those involving the leaf-cutting ants, the most voracious and
 proliferating herbivore across human-modified landscapes in the
 Neotropics. Here we evaluate the effect of chronic anthropogenic
 disturbance (e.g. firewood collection, livestock grazing) and vegetation
 seasonality on foraging area, foliage availability in the foraging area,
 leaf consumption, and herbivory rate of the leaf-cutting ant Atta
 opaciceps in the semi-arid Caatinga, a mosaic of dry forest and scrub
 vegetation in northeast Brazil. Contrary to our initial expectation, the
 foraging area was not affected by either disturbance intensity or the
 interaction between season and disturbance intensity. However, leaf
 consumption and herbivory rate were higher in more disturbed areas. We
 also found a strong effect of seasonality, with higher leaf consumption
 and herbivory rate in the dry season. Our results suggest that the
 foraging ecology of leaf-cutting ants is modulated by human disturbance
 and seasonality as these two drivers affect the spectrum and the amount of
 resources available for these ants in the Caatinga. Despite the low
 productivity of Caatinga vegetation, the annual rates of biomass
 consumption by A. opaciceps are similar to those reported from other
 leaf-cutting ants in rainforests and savannas. This is made possible by
 maintaining high foraging activity even in the peak of the dry season and
 taking benefit from any resource available, including low-quality items.
 Such compensation highlights the adaptive capacity of LCA to persist or
 even proliferate in human-modified landscapes from dry to rainforests.},
