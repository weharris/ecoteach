	abstract = {Globally, urban expansion has led to habitat fragmentation and altered
 resource availability thus posing significant challenges for wildlife.
 This study analyzed spatial distribution, habitat use patterns, and
 anthropogenic impacts on habitat occupancy of the Critically Endangered
 Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) in the urban landscape of Dharan
 Sub-metropolitan City, Nepal. Using a single-season occupancy modelling
 approach, we investigated the factors influencing the detection
 probability and habitat occupancy of Chinese pangolins in 134 grids of
 each 600 m Ã— 600 m. Our study identified the role of termite mounds in
 influencing detection probability, emphasizing the species'
 myrmecophilous behavior. Additionally, the Human Disturbance Index (HDI)
 emerged as a significant factor negatively affecting habitat occupancy of
 Chinese pangolins. We observed a medium level of anthropogenic
 disturbances in the grids where pangolin presence was detected. The
 findings emphasize the need for targeted conservation efforts, considering
 the fine-scale ecological and anthropogenic factors impacting Chinese
 pangolins in urban and peri-urban areas. The results underscore the
 urgency of implementing effective conservation measures to ensure the
 long-term survival of Critically Endangered Chinese pangolins in urban
 environments, not only in Dharan but also in similar lowlands areas and
 the Churia range of Nepal.},
