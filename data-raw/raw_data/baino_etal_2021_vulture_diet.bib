	abstract = {1. Dietary studies in birds of prey involve direct observation and
 examination of food remains at resting and nesting sites. Although these
 methods accurately identify diet in raptors, they are time consuming,
 resource intensive and associated with biases that stem from the feeding
 ecology of raptors like Gyps vultures (Gyps
 africanus and Gyps rueppelli). Our study set out to
 estimate diet composition in Gyps vultures informed by
 stable isotopes that provide a good representation of assimilated diet
 from carrion resources in local systems.  2. We hypothesized that
 differences in Gyps vulture diet composition is a
 function of sampling location, and that these vultures move between
 Serengeti National Park and Selous Game Reserve to forage. We also,
 theorized that grazing ungulates are the principal items
 in Gyps vulture diet.  3. Through a combination
 of linear and Bayesian models, diet derived from d13C
 in Gyps vultures consisted of grazing herbivores across
 study areas, with those in Serengeti National Park consuming higher
 proportions of grazing herbivores (\&gt; 87\%). d13C
 differences in vulture feather subsets per site did not indicate vulture
 diet change, and in combination with blood d13C, vultures fed
 largely on grazers for {\textasciitilde}159 days before they were sampled in both sites.
 Similarly, d15N values implied
 that Gyps vultures fed largely on herbivores across
 space and time. d34S ratios separated prey source for
 vultures between the two sites. d34S variation in
 vultures across sites resulted from differences in baseline
 (plant) d34S values, though it is not possible to
 match d34S to specific locations.  4. Our findings
 highlight the relevance of repeated sampling that considers tissues with
 varying isotopic turnover and emerging Bayesian techniques for dietary
 studies using stable isotopes. Findings also suggested limited vulture
 movement between the two local systems. However, more sampling coupled
 with telemetry is required to fully comprehend this observation and its
 implications to Gyps vulture ecology and conservation.},
