## Methods

Data was collected for 10 months as a masters research project. Gyps vulture, herbivore muscle tissue samples were collected from two protected areas Serengeti National Park and Selous Game Reserve in Tanzania. Samples were then processed for stable carbon, nitrogen and sulfur isotope analysis. Statistical analyses on stable isotope data, were carried out in R to inform Gyps vulture diet over space and time. 

## Other

Coordinates have been denatured by +0.5 degrees to preserve the integrity of the overall geographic distribution but ensure confidentiality.

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: Noose lines, which are smooth fishing line (1.70 mm thick|300lb strength) loosely tied into retractable circles along a ~1m parachute rope making a line frame, two-line frames were laid loosely around provisioned or natural bait (where available) and pegged to the ground by 3-inch x 3mm metal pegs. Traps were set as early as 0730hrs before peak vulture food search effort which ranges between 0800hrs and 1200hrs, we then retreated 50m to 60m from trap sites to observe vulture activity (Watson & Watson, 1985). Captured vultures were processed and released. Carcass tissue from dead ungulates was opportunistically collected within protected areas and stored in ethanol filled 1.5ml eppendorf tubes. Established transects under the Serengeti Biodiversity Programme in Serengeti National Park and Census data for Selous Game Reserve 2018/2019 from TAWIRI were used to estimate ungulate counts. All capture and carcass geographic coordinates were recorded with GPS. 2\. Methods for processing the data: All samples were prepared and combusted in a PyroCube elemental analyzer (Elementar, Hanau, Germany) for d15N, d13C and d34S sequentially using an Elementar VisION IRMS at the NERC Life Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility, East Kilbride, UK 3\.
