## Methods

This dataset was collected with a passive acoustic monitoring and camera trap systems. We manually processed audio files and videos to confirm chimpanzee detections and create matrices of presence/absence for occupancy modelling. These matrices presented in the archive are the raw matrices: for the passive acoustic monitoring, the values correspond to detection/non detection per 30min files and for the camera traps, the values corresponds to detection/non detection per day of deployment. Further steps, as detailed in the manuscript (i.e. divide the sampling period into sampling occasions of 8 days) have been conducted to create the occupancy model.

## Other

Detection histories were compiled into matrices containing two different values: (0) non detection and (1) detection. When no survey was conducted during a sampling occasion (e.g. due to camera or audio recorder malfunctioning or not deployed), a value of NA was assigned. The value (1) corresponds to at least one detection during a sampling occasion.

1. With one million animal species at risk of extinction, there is an
 urgent need to regularly monitor threatened species. However, in practice
 this is challenging, especially with wide-ranging, elusive and cryptic
 species or those that occur at low density. 2. Here we compare two
 non-invasive methods, passive acoustic monitoring (n=12) and camera
 trapping (n=53), to detect chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in a
 savanna-woodland mosaic habitat at the Issa Valley, Tanzania. With
 occupancy modelling we evaluate the efficacy of each method, using the
 estimated number of sampling days needed to establish chimpanzee absence
 with 95% probability, as our measure of efficacy. 3. Passive acoustic
 monitoring was more efficient than camera trapping in detecting wild
 chimpanzees. Detectability varied over seasons, likely due to social and
 ecological factors that influence party size and vocalization rate. The
 acoustic method can infer chimpanzee absence with less than ten days of
 recordings in the field during the late dry season, the period of highest
 detectability, which was five times faster than the visual method. 4.
 Synthesis and applications: Despite some technical limitations, we
 demonstrate that passive acoustic monitoring is a powerful tool for
 species monitoring. Its applicability in evaluating presence/absence,
 especially but not exclusively for loud call species, such as cetaceans,
 elephants, gibbons or chimpanzees provides a more efficient way of
 monitoring populations and inform conservation plans to mediate
 species-loss.
