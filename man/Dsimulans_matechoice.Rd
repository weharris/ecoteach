\description{
A dataset containing observations of mate choice decisions of \emph{Drosophila simulans}
females from three different populations to test whether they copy the mate choice of
their conspecifics. The study tested whether female fruit flies acquire a sexual
preference for a particular trait of a male after observing a single mating event.
The experimental protocol involved a naïve, unmated female first observing a conspecific's
mate choice between one artificially colored green and one artificially colored pink male,
and subsequently being allowed to choose between two males of the same phenotype herself.
