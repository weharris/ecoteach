\title{Leaf-Cutting Ant Herbivory Under Human Disturbance}
\format{
A data frame with 16 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
\item{Colony}{Integer, unique identifier for each ant colony studied}
\item{Disturbance_Index}{Numeric, quantitative measure of anthropogenic disturbance
intensity (higher values indicate greater disturbance from activities like
firewood collection and livestock grazing)}
\item{season}{Factor with levels "Dry" and "Wet", indicating the season when
measurements were taken}
\item{herbivory_percent}{Numeric, percentage of available vegetation consumed
by the ant colony}
}

\description{
This dataset examines how anthropogenic disturbance and seasonality affect
herbivory rates by leaf-cutting ants (Atta opaciceps) in the Caatinga dry forest
of northeastern Brazil. The data include measurements of herbivory percentages
from eight ant colonies across different disturbance intensities during both
wet and dry seasons.
}
\details{
The study found that human disturbance promotes higher herbivory rates by
leaf-cutting ants, with particularly strong effects during the dry season.
Despite the low productivity of Caatinga vegetation, these ants maintain
foraging activity even during peak dry season by utilizing whatever resources
are available, highlighting their adaptive capacity in human-modified landscapes.

The researchers measured herbivory rates across a gradient of human disturbance
in the Catimbau National Park, a protected area in northeastern Brazil. The study
reveals that leaf-cutting ants can maintain high rates of herbivory even in
disturbed and seasonally dry environments, which has implications for understanding
ecosystem functioning in human-modified tropical dry forests.
