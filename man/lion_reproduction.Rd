\description{
This dataset contains reproductive performance data for female Galapagos sea lions
(Zalophus wollebaeki) collected over a 13-year period in the Galapagos archipelago.
The data includes information on mother birth dates, body mass, age at first reproduction,
and offspring details. This dataset was used to study life history traits and
reproductive trade-offs of this tropical apex predator in an unpredictable habitat.
