\description{
This dataset contains observations of scavenger communities along an environmental gradient
from boreal forest to alpine tundra in central Scandinavia. The data was collected using
baited camera traps to quantify the structure of the winter scavenger community and assess
how climatic conditions affected spatial patterns of species occurrences at baits. The study
found that habitat type (forest or alpine tundra) and snow depth were main determinants of
community structure. Occurrence at baits by habitat generalists (red fox, golden eagle, and
common raven) typically increased at low temperatures and high snow depth, likely due to
increased energetic demands and lower abundance of natural prey in harsh winter conditions.
