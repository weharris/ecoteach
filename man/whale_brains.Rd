\description{
A dataset containing endocranial volume and body mass measurements for various cetacean
(whale) species and other mammals. This dataset was compiled to study the evolution of
hearing and brain size in Eocene whales. It includes both extant (living) and fossil
species, with a focus on understanding how brain size evolved in relation to body mass
and hearing adaptations across different taxonomic groups. The dataset is particularly
valuable for teaching concepts in comparative anatomy, allometry, and cetacean evolution.
}
\details{
Toothed whales (odontocetes) use high-frequency sounds to echolocate, differing
significantly from baleen whales (mysticetes), which use low-frequency sound for
long-distance communication. This dataset helps explore how hearing functioned in
ancestral archaeocetes, and when the specializations of modern species arose.
