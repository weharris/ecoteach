\description{
This dataset examines how southern house wrens (Troglodytes aedon musculus)
adjust their songs in response to both anthropogenic noise and territorial
challenges in urban and rural environments. The data include acoustic measurements
from playback experiments that simulated territorial intrusions in different
noise conditions.
}
\details{
The study investigates the potential trade-off between adjusting acoustic signals
to transmit effectively in noisy environments versus communicating aggressive intent
during territorial encounters. It includes measurements of song characteristics
such as frequency, bandwidth, and duration, along with contextual information
about habitat type and noise levels.

The researchers found that urban wrens behaved more aggressively in response to
territorial intrusion than rural wrens, regardless of noise levels. Males produced
songs with lower minimum frequency and wider frequency bandwidth during acute
aggressive encounters, suggesting these song characteristics communicate aggressive
intent or fighting ability. Urban wrens consistently produced higher-pitched songs
than rural wrens, and those in the noisiest territories produced the highest-pitched
trills, but only in non-aggressive contexts.

Collection period: 2018
Study locations: Urban and rural sites in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil
